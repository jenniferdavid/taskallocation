0.2.0 (2015-03-14)
------------------
* Linter fixes.
* Contributors: Mike Purvis

0.1.2 (2015-03-13)
------------------
* Add some basic install/uninstall tests.
* Add uninstall job method and script.
* Remove out of date README content, now forwards to ROS Wiki and generated documentation.
* Add a documentation section about permissions
* Contributors: GaÃ«l Ecorchard, Mike Purvis

0.1.1 (2015-01-20)
------------------
* Python Rewrite
* The startup event is too early for ROS to start, use local-filesystems instead.
* Remove bash versions of the install and uninstall utilities.
* Add support for supplying the --wait flag to roslaunch.
* Add Sphinx documentation.
  To get the argparse docs required moving most of the install
  script to a module, which probably should have been done anyway.
* Add a new-implementation install script, refactor Provider to be a class rather than function.
* Add roslint.
* Initial implementation of Python job generator.
* Port templated files to use empy.
  This gets rid of the bespoke templating system that was so bad. Also
  notable here is adding a --root flag to install somewhere other than
  the actual root. This needs to be further fleshed out, for example
  by not reinvoking with sudo when installing to non-root location.
* use LANG=C for ifconfig
* add argument to specify log directory
* Contributors: Eisoku Kuroiwa, Mike Purvis, ipa-mig
